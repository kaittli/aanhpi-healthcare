                        <h3>Antony Lin</h3>
                        <p>My name is Antony, and I'm a second-year Anthropology, BS, major at UCLA, but as of June of 2022, I will have graduated! I was born in San Jose, CA, but I've also lived in Sacramento and San Diego (both in CA still). My new obssession is this chocolate avocado vegan ice cream from Costco; I haven't had anything that good in like - a few weeks. K-pop and anime have been two really big parts of my life since I was super young, and I never thought I would let this secret see the light of day, but in my freshman year of high school, I watched about 800 episodes of One Piece in less than a month (not to mention all the other anime of the season). I'm an avid walker, and I've even walked all the way from UCLA to K-Town and back.<br/><br/>After finishing up at UCLA, I will be working full time as a clinical study coordinator with UCLA Health, and I hope to use this time to prepare for graduate school. I'm very excited to take the skills I've learned in ASIA AM 191A and apply them in my everyday life, and I hope I continue to have as many wonderful learning experiences while working as I did in this course.<br/><br/>To catch up with me, connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antony-lin/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/antummy/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>!</p>
