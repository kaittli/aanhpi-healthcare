            Health Services for UCLA Students
        </header>

        <div class="main">
            <div id="background">Project Background<br/>UCLA students are currently able to obtain medical care from the Ashe Center, which consists of any COVID-19 or comprehensive services that the center lists on its website. However, the inaccessibility of these Ashe Center has been demonstrated in a variety of posts by students, ranging from complaints regarding refusal of Ashe staff to treat students for injuries such as bleeding without a prior appointment to dismissive attitudes toward potentially severe conditions. This has led many students to seek treatment for less severe symptoms at the front desks of residential buildings and treatment for more severe symptoms at off-campus medical centers, or to simply not seek treatment at all. Overall, the lack of flexibility when it comes to unprompted or urgent medical attention coupled with the inadequate selection of alternatives provided by UCLA leave many students to fend for their health on their own.</div>
            <div id="aboutProject">About Project<br/>Our project aims to empower the overall UCLA student population, but may especially benefit those who require more frequent medical attention or those who have previously had poor experiences with the Ashe Center. These students can safely and confidentially share their experiences with both on-campus and off-campus health services. Through providing UCLA students' experiences seeking medical attention, students can be informed of the comprehensiveness of on-campus and off-campus medical services as well as the thoughts and feelings associated with it. In doing so, we also hope to start productive dialogue regarding the prevalence of Ashe Center services, especially for students with UCSHIP/BruinCare and learn about student reliance on off-campus medical services.</div>
