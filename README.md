Q: What social problem is being addressed? 

With our mapplication, we hope to address the issue of AANHPI (Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander) individuals who gravitate toward CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) due to the existence of barriers that prevent them from accessing biomedical health care systems and services.

Q: Who is being empowered by your mapplication? 

AANHPI individuals facing barriers to forms of health care that are widely accessed in the United States as well as health care outreach programs and activists are being empowered through our mapplication.

Q: What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?

We foresee potential communication issues with the population we are trying to reach, especially seeing as one of the barriers to accessing particular forms of health care is language ability; additionally, it would be fallacious to assume that people resort to CAM out of necessity, rather than choice, and we would need to find a way to represent this difference, or else we would be creating an unethical and incorrect representation of our target population.

Q: Reach out to a non-profit organization that your crowd-sourced mapping application could help support and mention them in the write-up.

Weâ€™re hoping that our crowd-sourced mapping application could support organizations such as the UCLA Health Center for East-West Medicine as well as the Health Access Project of the Los Angeles branch of Asian Americans Advancing Justice.
