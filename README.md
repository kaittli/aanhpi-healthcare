## What social problem is being addressed? 

Healthcare accessibility has been a longstanding issue among college students. Our mapplication aims to learn about the UCLA student population’s experiences regarding medical care while at UCLA, including on-campus and off-campus institutions. On campus, the focus is on visits through the Ashe Center, which is UCLA’s main treatment center that offers a variety of student health services. In doing so, we hope to discover more about potential struggles with seeking medical attention as a UCLA student, especially in relation to accessibility, flexibility, and the potential influence of different healthcare plans. 

## Who is being empowered by your mapplication? 

Through our mapplication, students at UCLA who have sought out care can confidently and confidentially share their stories concerning medical attention at UCLA. Concurrently, individuals who are interested in or are seeking other healthcare options, including individuals who have not received medical care around UCLA, can use the mapplication to explore people’s experiences with nearby health services. Voices that may otherwise have been hidden can be shared with the student body. 

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?

Healthcare issues can be very personal, so there may not be as much detail in the specifics with user stories as expected or individuals may not feel comfortable with sharing their stories at all. This may lead to receiving stories that are not representative of all perspectives. As for technical issues, there may be problems with depicting the specific location of healthcare places as not all addresses received by the survey are super comprehensive. Hence, there may be discrepancies in the placement of markers on the map or cases where we as creators have to make judgements on how to represent distinct locations. 

## What technology is used by this project?

For this project we will be employing different tools such as Leaflet and papaparse to create our map as well as to import our community data into our project. To collect our data, we are utilizing a survey that we have created through Google Forms and PapaParse for JavaScript to parse our collected data. Additionally, we are using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to construct and style our website. 

## How others can use this project in the future

This mapplication will allow the UCLA student population and associated organizations such as UC Leadership and the Student Health Committee to be educated of experiences with medical care on or around UCLA’s campus. Through gaining this first-hand information, it can lead to subsequent discussions on potential changes to be implemented within the Ashe Center’s procedures and allow individuals in need of medical care to make informed decisions. Vulnerable student populations through this project may use this project as a platform to advocate for improved accessibility and flexibility pertaining to health care services related to the Ashe Center.
