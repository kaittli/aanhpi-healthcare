## Objective

Healthcare accessibility has been a longstanding issue among college students. Our mapplication aims to learn about the UCLA student population’s experiences regarding medical care while at UCLA, including on-campus and off-campus institutions. On campus, the focus is on visits through the Ashe Center, which is UCLA’s main treatment center that offers a variety of student health services. In doing so, we hope to discover more about potential struggles with seeking medical attention as a UCLA student, especially in relation to accessibility, flexibility, and the potential influence of different healthcare plans. 

## Who is being empowered by this mapplication? 

Through our mapplication, students at UCLA who have sought out care can confidently and confidentially share their stories concerning medical attention at UCLA. Concurrently, individuals who are interested in or are seeking other healthcare options, including individuals who have not received medical care around UCLA, can use the mapplication to explore people’s experiences with nearby health services. Voices that may otherwise have been hidden can be shared with the student body. 

## What technology was used by this project?

For this project we will be employing different tools such as Leaflet and PapaParse to create our map as well as to import our community data into our project. To collect our data, we are utilizing a survey that we have created through Google Forms and PapaParse for JavaScript to parse our collected data. Additionally, we are using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to construct and style our website.

## What technical and ethical problems could there be in developing this tool?

Healthcare issues can be very personal, so there may not be as much detail in the specifics with user stories as expected or individuals may not feel comfortable with sharing their stories at all. This may lead to receiving stories that are not representative of all perspectives. As for technical issues, there may be problems with depicting the specific location of healthcare places as not all addresses received by the survey are super comprehensive. Hence, there may be discrepancies in the placement of markers on the map or cases where we as creators have to make judgements on how to represent distinct locations.  

## How can this website be repurposed?

This website may be repurposed for other ethical issues where there is a focus on the mapping of different locations as well as the amplification of voices from these locations. Numerous factors can be examined in regards to the ethical issue through the use of multiple map layers and cpie charts that are conditional through the click of a button. Our "read more stories" page can show exhuastive information about user experiences, feelings, and thoughts, and our cluster marker may allow for a more in-depth dive at a specific location of interest. 

## Long-Term Impact.

This mapplication can be used to learn about the sentiments and stories of UCLA students who have visited the Ashe Center or other nearby medical faciltiies. The UCLA student population and associated organizations such as UC Leadership and the Student Health Committee can explore the mapplication to be educated of experiences with medical care on or around UCLA’s campus. Through gaining this first-hand information, it can lead to subsequent discussions on potential changes to be implemented within the Ashe Center’s procedures and allow individuals in need of medical care to make informed decisions. Vulnerable student populations through this project may use this project as a platform to advocate for improved accessibility and flexibility pertaining to health care services related to the Ashe Center. 

## Screenshots of Features of the website 
1. Home Page: Our home page contains our main panel, showcasing our mapplication along with buttons and piecharts that are conditional based on what you are interested in seeing! Specifically, our map has individual markers that when clicked, popup with survey information as well as a cluster marker that provides the ability to view multiple markers in one location. Our control panel can filter criteria to swap information that you are interested in seeing and also contains a button that links to another page with anonymized information.

2. Response Page: Our response page contains two charts, the one on top contains responses relevant to the Ashe Center while the one on the bottom contains responses pertaining to other medical centers nearby.

## Room for Improvement

This project can also be added onto in the future with goals improving the map interactivity. Rather than popups for each marker, perhaps opening up modals for each experience would be more impactful. Another idea would be including word clouds for experiences once the site obtains more and more responses—it could show what similarities in experiences may exist among individuals. We also would like to eventually make changes to our cluster marker so that the purpose is more distinguishable. Additionally, we also hope to be able to make the pie charts trigger the markers in our map somehow in the future.

## Acknowledgements

Huge thank you to Professor Kochaphum for guiding us through this project from its conception to its execution. Truly would not have been able to do the project without his help! Another shoutout to all of the visiting voices for sharing their stories with mapmaking and ethics that have inspired our group to create this mapplication.
